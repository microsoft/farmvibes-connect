# LoRaWAN Network Server 

The LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS) is responsible for managing a LoRaWAN network, including handling connectivity protocols and security. You can find more details about LNS [here](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/news/what-lorawan-network-server/).  While LNS is generally cloud-based, it can also be hosted on the edge. It communicates directly with gateways for management and receives data packets forwarded by them. An LNS can oversee multiple gateways and their associated node devices. FarmVibes.Connect's network server is based on an open-source implementation of network server -- [Azure IoT Edge LoRaWAN Starter Kit](https://azure.github.io/iotedge-lorawan-starterkit/2.2.1/). Although this kit includes implementations for node devices, gateways (using LoRa Basicsâ„¢ Station), and the LoRaWAN Network Server, FarmVibes.Connect utilizes only the network server in its pipeline. We provide a [patch](/src/lns/lns_patch.patch) that can be applied to the open-source [Azure IoT Edge LoRaWAN Starter Kit](https://azure.github.io/iotedge-lorawan-starterkit/2.2.1/) to obtain the FarmVibes.Connect's network server implementation. To build and setup the network server after applying the patch, please follow the instructions provided in the [Azure IoT Edge LoRaWAN Starter Kit](https://azure.github.io/iotedge-lorawan-starterkit/2.2.1/).
